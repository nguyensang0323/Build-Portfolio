# Sang's Portfolio
In this project, I designed a live portfolio that encompasses all my works throughout the Coding Bootcamp.

## Project Description
This initial portfolio is comprised of an HTML file and CSS File. The HTML file is composed of multiple sections:
- A header that includes my name along with a navigation bar that links to other sections of the page.
- My image along with a welcome note.
- A brief description about myself in the About Me section.
- All my projects displayed in the Works sections.
- A footer with information on how to contact me via phone, GitHub, or email.
The CSS file integraed flexbox properties to make the styling of the page more coherent. Colors were added to make the page more engaging. This portfolio will continue to develop as I progress through the Bootcamp.
